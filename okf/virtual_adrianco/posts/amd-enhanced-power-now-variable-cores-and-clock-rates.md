# Amd Enhanced Power Now   Variable Cores And Clock Rates






## Excerpt

Title: AMD Enhanced Power Now - Variable Cores and Clock Rates

There is an interesting <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/11/amd_enhanced_powernow/">article in The Register about the latest variant of AMD's enterprise power management system</a>.<br /><br />As <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2006/06/cpu-power-management.html">I've mentioned before</a>,  in the interests of saving power, some enterprise server systems are varying their clock rates so that they end up showing a higher utilization at low load levels that you would expect. This non-linear relationship of load to utilization is one of the things I highlighted in my CMG06 paper called "Utilization is virtually useless as a metric".<br /><br />The latest twist: in AMD's upcoming four core systems, individual cores will be stopped completely if there isn't enough work for them to do.<br /><br />The effect on utilization metrics will depend upon how each operating system interacts with the power management capabilities...<br /><br />For Solaris the so-called "idle loop" is actually quite busy. An idle CPU watches its neighb
